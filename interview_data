1. Recursively list all files in a directory including files in symlink directories ?
--> #ls -LR

2. If process is running or not on Linux ?
--> #pgrep nginx , # pgrep apache2, #pidof nginx

1. Python program to check if a string is palindrome or not ?
--> # function which return reverse of a string

def isPalindrome(s):
	return s == s[::-1]


# Driver code
s = "malayalam"
ans = isPalindrome(s)

if ans:
	print("Yes")
else:
	print("No")

2. Inbuilt Data Structures in Python ?
-->  Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.
     Lists: Lists in Python are one of the most versatile collection object types available. 
     The other two types are dictionaries and tuples, but they are really more like variations of lists.
Lists can be used for any type of object, from numbers and strings to more lists.
They are accessed just like strings (e.g. slicing and concatenation) so they are simple to use and they’re variable length, i.e. they grow and shrink automatically as they’re used.
In reality, Python lists are C arrays inside the Python interpreter and act just like an array of pointers.

Dictionary: In python, dictionary is similar to hash or maps in other languages. 
            It consists of key value pairs. The value can be accessed by unique key in the dictionary. 
            Keys are unique & immutable objects.
            dictionary = {"keyname": value}

Tuple : Python tuples work exactly like Python lists except they are immutable, 
        i.e. they can’t be changed in place. 
        They are normally written inside parentheses to distinguish them from lists (which use square brackets), 
        but as you’ll see, parentheses aren’t always necessary. Since tuples are immutable, their length is fixed. 
        To grow or shrink a tuple, a new tuple must be created. 

Sets: Unordered collection of unique objects. 
      Set operations such as union (|) , intersection(&), difference(-) can be applied on a set.
      Frozen Sets are immutable i.e once created further data can’t be added to them
      {} are used to represent a set.
      Objects placed inside these brackets would be treated as a set.
